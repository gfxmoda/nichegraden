Date: 24 February 2020
Branch: Seef Mall
Time: 6:30pm
Niche Garden launched the latest edition of men’s fragrance Aventus Clone by the international brand Creed, which is the best-selling item in men’s perfumes, in the presence of global perfume designer, Erwin Creed at the branch of the Seef complex on Monday February 24, 2020.

The owner and co-founder of the Niche brand, Erwin Creed, will take over the fragrance sector around the world, as it will become more prevalent than it is now, so that everyone will have at least one perfume in their possession.

Erwin, who is considered the seventh generation of the family, stated 50 years ago, the brand did not gain this global spread, but the Al-Hawaj group was one of the companies that hosted its perfumes in its stores, while Paris stores refused to offer our products, because of the lack of popularity of Niche perfumes, as brands of perfumes such as Chanel and Dior were the most popular.

And Erwin added: Creed is one of the founders of Niche perfumes. Today we manufacture perfumes in Paris with the participation of family members. We blend the ingredients on passion, to offer the finest perfumes. Niche perfumes are based not only on the volume of production, but also on the production of optimum quality that is not the same as other perfumes.

Erwin pointed out that the perfume marks depend on certain criteria regarding the prolongation of the fragrance’s stability, as the aroma of the ingredients varies from individual to individual, indicating that most companies are now producing Eau de toilette perfumes with the same concentration of perfume.

The fragrance carries with its new classic version a more refreshing scent with ingredients that merge to create a more spreading smell thanks to the notes of mandarin, ginger and pink pepper that interfere with old patchouli, sandalwood and vetiver, while they come in base notes of musk, tunga and birch Smoked leather scents, and the bottle comes with the emperor of the Roman emblem racing against his horse.
