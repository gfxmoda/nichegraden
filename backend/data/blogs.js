    No other flower has charmed us throughout history quite like rose. Cleopatra famously scented the sails of her ship with rose water and filled her palace with petals to win over Mark Antony; Gertrude Stein called out the flower in the poem “Sacred Emily,” writing “Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose;” and, of course, William Shakespeare was a fan. Roses are synonymous with romance and have been forever; in Greek mythology, they were associated with Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty. Whereas some flowers dominate in either fragrance or appearance, roses are equally exquisite in both. Simply put, they’re irresistible.

    It’s often said that rose is the queen of flowers, but you could argue that the elegant perennial is the queen of fragrance as well. It’s perfumery’s most beloved floral note—and with its lush, dewy, complex bouquet, it can be blended to achieve myriad, and unisex, results. Rose can be traditional, honey-sweet and ultra-feminine, or bold, peppery, and statement-worthy.
    
    There are hundreds of varieties of the flower—from the mesmerizing lilac amnesia rose to the endlessly-petaled garden variety—but the most favored in perfumery are the Damask Rose and luscious rosa centifolia, which are grown in Bulgaria, Turkey, Morocco, Tunisia, and France. In the mood for the dreamy flower? Learn about some of our rose-laced blends, below.
    
    Floralie: The All-Out Floral Rose.

    With a name like Floralie, you can expect a flower-forward scent, and the fragrance is gloriously, unapologetically so. To wear it is like breathing in a freshly-cut bouquet. It’s simultaneously rich, delicate, fresh, and slightly dank thanks to a mix of deep, velvety Bulgarian rose, heady tuberose and lilac, along with a subtle hint of sunny marigold. All that lushness is then countered by a soft and warm base of zesty cedar, amber, and musk. Master Perfumer Olivier Creed’s goal was to celebrate flowers as art, and Floralie delivers.

Viking: The Commanding, Spicy Rose.

Viking proves that rose doesn’t have to be girly or traditional. The top notes are spicy and bright—thanks to pink peppercorn, Sicilian lemon, and Italian bergamot—and an attractive combo of Bulgarian rose and peppermint lends a cool, rich edge. Olivier Creed was inspired by Viking ships—and the courage, determination, and strength they symbolize—and their mighty vibe, which is further emphasized by the masculine foundation of vetiver, patchouli, sandalwood, and lavender, is translated to any who choose to don it.

Love in White: The Smooth and Delicate Rose.

There’s something about smelling Love in White that makes you feel totally at peace. It’s cashmere-soft, feminine, sophisticated, clean. Rose isn’t immediately detectable—the fragrance

opens with luminous Italian orange zest—but as it unfolds you’ll pick up a mellow and addicting mixture of soothing iris, French daffodil, fresh magnolia, dewy Bulgarian rose, powdery rice and a yummy, creamy base of vanilla and sandalwood.

    BEHIND THE DESTINATION

    At Memo Paris we’re nomads, and our fragrances are the journeys that we take from one magical destination to another, whether it is Ireland, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Russia, the US or, Africa. But eventually the journey leads us back to Paris, home to our flagship store on Rue Cambon, and to three of our fragrances  Quartier Latin ,  French Leather , and  Eau de Memo .
    
    It’s also home for Memo Paris co-founder and creative director, Clara Molloy, who grew up in the centre of the French capital. The beginnings of the brand can be found along the banks of the Seine, down the lively streets of Saint-Germain-des-Prés and among the city’s many bookstores, cafés and galleries. Here, Clara shares some of her favourite addresses to visit when in Paris.

    La Palette

Pablo Picasso and Ernest Hemingway are just a few of the artists and writers to have frequented this historic bistro in Paris’ 6th arrondissement. Its art deco style rooms and pretty terrace, which looks out onto rue Jacques Callot, have also long been a meeting place for local Beaux Arts students and nearby gallery owners. It’s an institution, a place that has not changed for the past 30 years at least. No designer could recreate its atmosphere; it has its own charm.

L’Écume des Pages

Open almost every day until midnight, L’Écume des Pages, a bookshop at the heart of Saint- Germain-des-Présis, is a veritable treasure trove for night owls and dreamers who, having stumbled out of a dinner or even drinks next door at the literary hangout, Café de Flore, find themselves almost instinctively among its bookshelves with a sudden thirst for the written word. I love that it is open late at night : you see books in a different way when it is dark outside.

Galerie Kamel Mennour

Kamel Mennour’s three Parisian galleries (47, rue Saint-André des Arts, 6 rue du Pont de Lodi and 28 Avenue Matignon) display the works more than thirty different young contemporary and internationally recognised artists including Claude Lévêque, Anish Kapoor, and Cameron Jamie. Kamel Mennour explores contemporary art in may ways, with artists that always tell subtlely their stories.

Shakespeare and Company

Everything about this eccentric English-language bookshop draws you in, from its rickety floors and narrow labyrinth-like corridors leading to cosy rooms lined with endless rows of books. If you’re lucky Agatha, the resident cat, may even curl up beside you as you delve into a good novel. Located on the banks of the Seine, in Paris’ bohemian Latin Quarter, it is no coincidence that our namesake perfume, Quartier Latin, evokes the familiar musty scent of book pages with its distinct sandalwood scent.

Caveau de la Huchette

Le Caveau de la Huchette is a jazz club in the Latin Quarter of Paris dating back to 1949. Stepping into this underground cave is like being transported to another world, especially when the music starts. It made a recent appearance in the 2017 Hollywood movie La La Land. Le Caveau has a sometimes  melancholic but always beautiful Parisian touch.

Brasserie Lipp

Not far from café La Palette you will find another Parisian institution, Brasserie Lipp, which has been serving traditional French cuisine since 1880. Decked in wall to wall mirrors and smooth leather benches, Lipp’s immaculate décor, service and authentic menu are just some of the reasons customers have been returning for the last 138 years.

Le Balzar

Le Balzar was created in 1890 and they have the best crème caramel of the world. I have always preferred bistros to restaurants. And this one is in front of the Ecume des pages. So now you know how a typical night out in Paris goes for me: Brasserie Lipp and then L’Écume des pages. Or you will find me at Le Balzar and then the library in front of it : Librairie Compagnie, they have a good poetry department.

    Finding the new field of black roses in  Halfeti  was a source of much excitement to the village as well as to William Penhaligon himself. He was happy that he had found the main ingredient for his new fragrance, Halfeti but also relieved to be returning home, back to life in St James where he could get down to creating his latest fragrances and introduce them to his loyal clients. 

    As the town gathered to say farewell to William, he thought about the adventures he might have on his way home. The trip over was conducted in such a rush, his only thought being the black roses, that he was relishing the stops to pick up ingredients on the way home. He looked back at all the faces smiling up at him and waved his farewell. The spectacle of his flying machine had caused quite a stir. 
    
    The takeoff was just as fast and as noisy as ever but this time he lost concentration for a moment and found himself thrown backwards. He reached out to hang on to the guy ropes and was thrown into shock as he nearly fell out. He looked nervously over to where he had placed his case. It was open and its contents were strewn on the floor. His map book was open and face down. As he checked it for damage, he noticed a dotted line had appeared from Halfeti to the coast by Kas before heading over Greece and into Calabria, Italy making its way over via Aix and Paris. 
    
    After a few days of flying, William stopped off in Reggio Calabria to source bergamot; a delicate citrus that William enjoyed in his Earl Grey tea each afternoon back in London. Arriving here, he was surprised by this rather unattractive fruit. It may not have looked like much but the oils were something else. William would use bergamot as a fresh top note in many fragrances to come. From Calabria on the toe of Italy’s boot, William took a short flight to Sicily where he found blood oranges. Their juice, ruby red like drops of blood and with the flavour and fragrance is of an intense orange. The more ingredients he found, the more he knew that this was not going to be his last trip.
    
    The surprising thing was that there was a welcoming committee at each stop as if this trip had been planned with military precision. Dignitaries, bands, refreshments, transport and accommodation had been laid on as if everyone was expecting him. Except that it hadn’t been planned and to be honest, William didn’t know where the flying machine would take him from one stop to another.
    
    The same thing happened again in Aix en Provence. This time, William smiled as he was whisked off in a large automobile to see the lavender. He consulted his map for the best fields and then turned over the page to the next leg of the trip; the journey back to England. He would be home in time for the weekend. William noticed something strange; another page had been added to the book; a whole page dedicated to Egypt and the Nile. He sat back in the car and although he could feel the gentle caress of lavender in his nostrils, his thoughts were taking him to the ancient cities of Luxor, Dendera, Thebes and Giza. He now knew that this was going to be  his next big adventure  and he was already composing his next fragrance. 
    
    Most definitely to be continued…
